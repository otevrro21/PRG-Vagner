   ```sh
   cmake --build .
   ```
   
### IMPORTANT!

To use PicoSDK with RPi Pico 2, build the make file like this:
```ps
cmake -DPICO_PLATFORM=rp2350 ..
```

### Flashing the Firmware to the RP2040 Board

1. Connect the RP2040 board to your computer.
2. Press and hold the BOOTSEL button while plugging the board into USB.
3. Copy the generated `.uf2` file from the `build` directory to the RP2040 USB mass storage device.

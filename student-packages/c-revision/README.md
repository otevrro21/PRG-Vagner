# Assignment: C Programming Revision

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to revise your knowledge of C programming by implementing a program that generates an ASCII art of a house based on given height and width from command line arguments. The program should handle basic errors.

## Task

1. Write a C program that generates an ASCII art of a house. The height and width of the house should be provided as command line arguments.

2. Your program should:

   - Validate the command line arguments to ensure the width is an odd number.
   - Inform the user if the specified width is not odd and that the house cannot be printed.
   - Generate and print the ASCII art of the house based on the given height and width.

3. Example usage:
   ```
   ./house 7 8
   ```
4. Example output for the above command with an outline of the house:
   ```
      X
     X X
    X   X
   XXXXXXX
   X     X
   X     X
   X     X
   X     X
   X     X
   X     X
   XXXXXXX
   ```
